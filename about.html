            <h1>Hello & Welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the <em>Rainbow 6: Siege</em><!-- M1LO10 --> North American League Championship Website!
              Here you will find information regarding the teams, players, their stats, standings, and more.
              As the tournament progresses, the site will be updated with the winning team
              and the stats for that match. I hope you enjoy the site and don't forget to reinforce!

            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>This website was created as my capstone project for a web development course
                at Olympic College. It's goal is to showcase the knowledge I've gained throughout the quarter,
                while also having some fun with the topic and such. As I am a beginner, expect to see a lot of changes 
                and edits to the site as time goes on. 
                Thank you for joining me on this journey and I hope you enjoy the site!
            </p>
            <h2>What's New?</h2>
            <p>
                For this version, I have added another new page for the operators, and adjusted my CSS file accordingly. Next time, I  intend to add the championship 
                page to display the results and stats from it.
